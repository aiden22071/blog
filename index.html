        <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize">I had visited it in dec 2022</h5>

        <p class="text-muted">Roti Prata, a ‘pancake bread’ possibly originating from Pakistani or Indian paratha, is made from simple ingredients of flour, sugar and salt. Water is added to the flour to form a dough. The dough is then kneaded to make it soft and pliable. The dough is then flattened and flipped and swirled and twirled into a large thin layer before heating it on a hot plate.

          Traditionally, pratas can be eaten with curry, sugar, condensed milk or just plain. This has evolved to include flavours as varied as garlic, banana, chocolate, durian and cheese. More recently, the dish has also evolved to other sweeter and crispier variants such as "tissue" and "paper" which are pan-fried with butter, rolled into a cone shape and sprinkled with sugar.
          
          From the 80s to the early 90s, the more discerning in Singapore would invariably congregate in Jalan Kayu, considered by many to be the mecca of prata-lovers. Today, Casuarina Road (off Upper Thomson Road) is just as well known and possibly even more popular. This is partly due to popular prata joints like Casuarina Curry Restaurant which was started there in 1992. In fact, Casuarina Curry Restaurant is a 2nd Generation Indian curry and prata restaurant with roots in Jalan Kayu.
          
          With the support from our customers, we have won numerous adwards and accolades and are rated as one of the best in Singapore; our more than 40 varieties of prata will delight and pamper our diner's taste buds. From our humble beginning, we are constantly seeking to innovate and improve and now offer a full repertoire of popular Indian curry dishes in our restaurants as well as catering service for events in your offices or homes. In fact, we are the first in Singapore to offer Prata On The Spot, a catering service to make prata on your doorstep!

        <p>You know a movie is outstanding when the end credits alone are more epic than the majority of films released in the last 20 years! This film is the pure definition of an emotional roller coaster and throughout it's run time brings about fascination, humor, sadness, incredible excitement, and sheer finality. This is not your typical superhero movie and some viewers used to the entertaining, nonstop action style of the previous films may be disappointed, but I think that this movie brilliantly satisfies and subverts expectations. 

          The film's storytelling is some of the best ever seen in blockbuster filmaking, combining smart writing, intimate character moments, and exceptional world building to create one of the best blockbuster stories ever. The superheroes are all brilliantly acted and well written, with Robert Downey Jr, Scarlett Johannson, and Chris Evans in particular turning in some of the most human and enduring acting preformances I have ever seen. In addition, Josh Brolin once again proves utterly breathtaking as Thanos, and he somehow feels even more intimidating and horribly insane than he was in Infinity War. Further proving that Thanos is definitely among the very best movie villains of the last century.
          
          The action is honestly some of the finest in the history of cinema. The world renowned final battle of this film is riveting, heartbreaking, awe inspiring, and exceptionally well choreographed. Never before have I been so thoroughly moved and elated while watching a battle scene in film. The film's soundtrack is also one of the best of it's kind and brilliantly complements the action. It is filled with some of the most stunning, blood pumping, and epic music themes you will EVER hear. 
          
          And while the time travel elements (as with all time travel movies) are certainly questionable, as long as you don't spend a week thinking about them they most likely will not bother you. This is my favorite movie of all time (yes I do watch other movies too) and I don't think anything will ever top the experience of watching this movie opening night in the theatre. However even upon second viewings the film remains an utter blast to watch with tons of replay value due to the many eastereggs to previous films. Smart, beautiful, epic, and timeless this is a superhero masterpiece!</p>

            I'm a huge fan of the Harry Potter books, they're all so great and magical. But I didn't think the film series were perfect at all, but they were still great movies. With that, I was extremely excited to see the end of the film franchise, and impressed with the trailers. So I had high expectations. And thankfully it did not disappoint, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II, blew past my already high expectations and I was enthralled!

            The whole movie looked spectacular! The cinematography extremely well done, the art direction was incredible. The movie was beautiful to look at, the visuals were spectacular and truly Oscar worthy! The set designers, cinematographers really need to be awarded for their work, because it looks like they spend of time and money on the look of the film.

            The cast of the film was pretty much perfect, they should all be applauded too. Emma Watson, as usual is and great and she'll have a bright career ahead of her. Rupert Grint is pretty much great also, he is a fine actor indeed. Daniel Radcliffe did an amazing job and was very memorable as Harry Potter. Although I think Ralph Fiennes was the star of the film, he did unbelievable job as the evil, crazy Lord Voldemort, I think he deserves an Oscar Nomination for his role. The rest of the cast were also great too.

            We all grew up overtime with the series, we followed the adventures of Harry Potter for around 10 years, I think. It seems very weird that there will be no more Harry Potter films to look forward too. I will miss the franchise very much! However I am happy the series got an amazing ending. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II is not only the best film in the series, but it will probably be one of the best films of 2011. Everyone should see this film, even if they don't like past Harry Potter films.
